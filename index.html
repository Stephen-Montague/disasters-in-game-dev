            <h1>Disasters in Game Dev</h1>
            <P> <strong>This site is meant to record our indie game failures or works in progress that may never succeed: 
                until they do. After all - "Fail Fast, Fail Often" - (from the title of this 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fail-Fast-Often-Losing-Help/dp/0399166254" target="_blank"> book</a>), 
                only helps if you think about failure.  In a sense, an AI using MCTS-UCT, a powerful but simple algorithm, 
                uses this strategy - simulate many moves, record the results, and evaluate.  Anyway, so I've spent untold hours 
                in game design and development, but I haven't created a mini masterpiece, like Masters of Orion or Cave Story - 
                not even close - yet while it's awesome to think about making great games, I'm making time here for games that have 
                not gone so far yet, but have stories just the same. <span>&#128578;</span></P>
            <P>Speaking of stories, I considered naming this site "Game Dev Stories" but there's a book with that title, 
                and I thought about Tales of Game Dev (and similar), but there's companies who use this already. Luckily, I didn't find 
                many sites dedicated to Disasters in Game Dev, so I'll start here, and see where it goes.
